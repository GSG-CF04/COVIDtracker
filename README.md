### **Solution:** <span id='about'></span>
In this application, we display all information about covid-19 such as daily infection cases, total infections, number of active cases, total recovery cases and total deaths.
With a graph of cases by country
We add tips to protect you from COVID-19.

### **User stories:**

* As a user, you will be able to read the instructions to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus.
* As a user, you will be able to be aware about the infected cases and deaths numbers in your country.
* As a user, you will be able to skip instructions every time you access the page.

### **User Journey:**
The user enters the app and presses continue button through the home page. When you click on the continue button, it moves you to the next page where you can show the instructions of COVID-19, then you can skip or go to the next page that you can choose the country to know the number of active cases, recovered people and total deaths with digram.
